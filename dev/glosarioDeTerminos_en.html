There are several types of lays, and each type is determined by the arrangement of the strands in the cable and how the wires are positioned in the strands. Depending on the arrangement of the strand, it is defined whether the lay is right or left, and depending on the placement of the wires in the strand, it is defined as regular or Lang lay.</p>
